# Hymenium

The hymenium is the tissue layer on the hymenophore of a fungal fruiting body where the cells develop into basidia or asci, which produce spores. In some species all of the cells of the hymenium develop into basidia or asci, while in others some cells develop into sterile cells called cystidia (basidiomycetes) or paraphyses (ascomycetes). Cystidia are often important for microscopic identification. The subhymenium consists of the supportive hyphae from which the cells of the hymenium grow, beneath which is the hymenophoral trama, the hyphae that make up the mass of the hymenophore.

The position of the hymenium is traditionally the first characteristic used in the classification and identification of mushrooms. Below are some examples of the diverse types which exist among the macroscopic Basidiomycota and Ascomycota.

In agarics, the hymenium is on the vertical faces of the gills.
In boletes, it is in a spongy mass of downward-pointing tubes.
In puffballs, it is internal.
In stinkhorns, it develops internally and then is exposed in the form of a foul-smelling gel.
In cup fungi, it is on the concave surface of the cup.
In teeth fungi, it grows on the outside of tooth-like spines.

# thoughts that keep me awake

- focus on the user flow through the application there with be a few stages

## landing page

sign in
sign up

## then goes to a page where

manual mode
auto recognition mode  
mushroom index

auto recognition mode just displays a camera that is closed with the tes work in progress

## manual mode

is a page where people pick the characteristics of the mushroom they are attempting to identify

could be a single page will little boxes than have an onlick event that trigger a function to set a state of that characteristc

## results page

the results page in shown the the use when they have invoked all of the fucntion
-- have an option for them to click i dont know

the results pay with fetch all the matching mushrooms from the database or from the pre-rendered ones using context? or maybe pass down the prop the whole way not sure the ebst way to goa bout it

so when the user clicking submit then a result component will be renderd and this will be apssed the props from the form page

THIS IS MVP

the user then clicks on the mushroom to be brought to the page about the mushroom.

### lots more features to be added

- allow user to comment on each mushrooms and to upload their own picutres.


# design flow

look at some examples of user flow of the login, signup and initial landing pages
